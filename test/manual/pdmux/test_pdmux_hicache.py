"""PDMux + HiCache end-to-end verification. Needs one CUDA GPU with green
context support (compute capability >= 8.0).

    python -m pytest test/manual/pdmux/test_pdmux_hicache.py -v

Covers both PDMux SM layouts, since they share `event_loop_pdmux` and differ
only in how the prefill and decode streams are masked:

  - exclusive green-context partitions (the default divide)
  - overlapped masks (`overlap_decode_full_sm`: decode runs on the full device)

The server is deliberately configured to make the HiCache paths run rather than
sit idle: a small device KV pool forces eviction to host, `write_through` backs
every finished request up, and a small `split_forward_token_budget` makes each
prefill split per layer so it spans many scheduler iterations.

The scheduler-loop property HiCache depends on -- that transfer acks are
drained exactly once per iteration, including the iterations a split prefill
occupies -- is pinned deterministically in
test/registered/unit/multiplex/test_pdmux_hicache_events.py. These tests check
the end-to-end consequences: correct output after a host reload, and acks that
keep draining under long overlapped prefills.
